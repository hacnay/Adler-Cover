I am thrilled to submit my application for a position at Adler. As a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from Babu Banarasi Das Institute of Technology and Management, I have developed a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and AI. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to join Adler because of its reputation for technological innovation and its dynamic, forward-thinking culture.

Why have you chosen to join Adler?

Adler's pioneering work in the tech industry and its commitment to driving technological advancement are incredibly inspiring to me. The opportunity to be part of a team that is constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible aligns perfectly with my career aspirations and my passion for exploring and implementing cutting-edge technologies.

Why should Adler want to work with you?

My technical expertise and innovative mindset make me a strong candidate for Adler. During my internship at TCSiON, I successfully developed and deployed a machine learning project aimed at automating sentiment detection from text. This project, along with my ongoing work on NLP integration and AI bot development, showcases my ability to turn complex algorithms into practical, efficient solutions. Additionally, my leadership roles, such as serving as President of the College IT-Departmental Clubs, demonstrate my ability to lead and collaborate effectively in a team environment.

Are you crazy in some aspects?

Absolutely, I am the kind of "crazy" that drives innovation and creativity. My project "Motion Canvas," which uses a camera to draw based on the motion of a marker, exemplifies my willingness to experiment with unconventional ideas and push the limits of technology. This fearless approach to problem-solving ensures that I bring fresh, unique perspectives to every project I undertake.

What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

I firmly believe that embracing failure is essential for true innovation. While many view failure as a setback, I see it as a critical part of the learning process. Each failure teaches invaluable lessons and paves the way for future success. This mindset, though not widely accepted, has been instrumental in my personal and professional development, allowing me to continuously refine my skills and approaches.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to Adler's mission and look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my unique background, skills, and perspectives can add value to your team.

Sincerely,
Subhang Kumar
